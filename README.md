The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': Code used for analysis.

- 'total_select.csv': Dataset containing only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

- 'total_select_summary.csv': The average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Notes: 
======
- The run_analysis.R script performs:
  - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
